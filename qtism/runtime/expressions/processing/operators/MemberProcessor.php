/**
 * The MemberProcessor class aims at processing Member operators.
 * 
 * From IMS QTI:
 * 
 * The member operator takes two sub-expressions which must both have the same base-type. The first sub-expression must
 * have single cardinality and the second must be a multiple or ordered container. The result is a single boolean with a
 * value of true if the value given by the first sub-expression is in the container defined by the second sub-expression.
 * If either sub-expression is NULL then the result of the operator is NULL.
 * 
 * The member operator should not be used on sub-expressions with a base-type of float because of the poorly defined comparison of values.
 * It must not be used on sub-expressions with a base-type of duration.
