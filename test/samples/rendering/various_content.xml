		<h1>The F4U Corsair</h1>
		<p>
			The <strong>Chance Vought F4U Corsair</strong> was a carrier-capable fighter aircraft 
			that saw service primarily in World War II and the Korean War. Demand 
			for the aircraft soon overwhelmed Vought's manufacturing capability, 
			resulting in production by Goodyear and Brewster: Goodyear-built Corsairs 
			were designated <strong>FG</strong> and Brewster-built aircraft <strong>F3A</strong>. 
			From the first prototype delivery to the U.S. Navy in 1940, to final delivery in 1953 
			to the French, 12,571 F4U Corsairs were manufactured by Vought,[1] in 16 separate models, 
			in the longest production run of any piston-engined fighter in U.S. history (1942â€“53).
